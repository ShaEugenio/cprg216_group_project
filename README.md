This program has a management class that takes care of the navigation, user prompts, and program continuity.
Doctor class for information management which can be used to display, search, add and edit doctor information when
called. Facilities class can add and display facilities when called. Read method for facilities class was also added
for consistency with the other classes. Laboratories class can display and add laboratory name and corresponding
price. Patient class can display, add, and edit patients' information when called. This program does not provide
input validation, so it assumes user is entering the correct data type. Program runs continuously unless the user
enters 0 on the main menu, only then that it terminates.
